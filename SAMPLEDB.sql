You were taken prisoner after running into an Imperial Army ambush while crossing the border to Skyrim. The prisoner caravan you are part of is destined for the small Empire stronghold of Helgen. After you get off the cart, the guards begin calling out names, looking for members of the Stormcloaks. Eventually, you are ordered by an Imperial soldier named Hadvar to identify yourself, which will lead to a prompt to create your character. Despite your lack of involvement with the Stormcloaks, the captain of the guard orders you to be executed. A Priestess of Arkay will start saying a prayer, but as soon as she mentions the eight divines a stormcloak will interrupt her, and the executions begin. Not long after the executions start, they call you forward. Following the direction given to you by the guards, you lie down on the execution block.\r\n\r\nCognitus Interruptus\r\n\r\nRight before the executioner can bring his halberd down on your neck, the dragon Alduin arrives and disrupts the execution. With the execution stopped and the guard in chaos, you take the opportunity to escape custody, and at this point the cinematic ends and you gain control of your character\'s movement with Ralof desperately yelling at you to get up. Run with Ralof towards the nearby tower, in which you will find several Stormcloak soldiers and Ulfric Stormcloak, who also escaped in the panic. Climb the stairs to where a Stormcloak Soldier is trying to move some rubble blocking access to the rest of the tower. Alduin will blast a hole through the wall and use a shout to breathe fire into the tower. Ralof will instruct you to jump out of the tower through the hole into a nearby building, with the promise that he will meet up with you when he can.\r\n\r\nAfter jumping down and exiting the inn, you will find that Helgen has become heavily damaged in quite a short time, with many buildings ruined and burning.The defending Imperial soldiers are caught up in the battle and are too busy to take any notice of you. Run into the street and you will encounter Hadvar, attempting to rush civilians to safety. One injured Nord, Torolf, unfortunately fails to escape the carnage, and is killed by the dragon\'s fire breath. After Alduin flies away to attack other targets, Hadvar will tell you to follow him if you want to stay alive. He will lead you towards Helgen Keep, a large Imperial fort in the village. At the entrance to the Keep, Ralof will catch up with you. At this point you must choose whether you wish to accompany Ralof or Hadvar for the remainder of the quest.',NULL),(8,4,'Before the Storm','First Steps\r\n\r\nAs you head out from the dungeon with either Hadvar or Ralof, the dragon that attacked Helgen will travel over your head. Hadvar or Ralof will advise you to get down, but you\'re free to stand up and watch the dragon fly away. Hadvar or Ralof will comment on the dragon and continue on the path. You can now explore the area and advance to Riverwood at your own pace or follow whoever is accompanying you down the path. Following Hadvar or Ralof does not grant any special bonuses, but you do get to listen to your companion detail about the world around you, and they will point out the Guardian Stones and let you pick one that suits your character. You may encounter a few lone wolves along the path. Exploring does have some advantages: any wolves you meet will yield pelts when killed, and you can check out the nearby Embershard Mine. You can also catch some salmon in the river, and there are usually some elk or other prey to hunt along the way, which yield hides, venison, and occasionally antlers to use in alchemy. At the end of the path, you and Hadvar or Ralof will arrive at Riverwood.\r\n\r\nA Friend of a Friend\r\n\r\nOnce you arrive at the village of Riverwood, you will be directed to speak to Alvor, the local smith (if you chose to follow Hadvar during the flight from Helgen) or Gerdur, the woodmill worker (if you chose to follow Ralof). Explain your situation and he or she will recommend you seek out the Jarl of the region, Jarl Balgruuf the Greater at his palace in Whiterun. They will also offer you what assistance they can (in the form of some low level food, potions and jewelry) to get you started. No matter what choice you have made, you can also help Alvor around his shop for some smithing experience, and Gerdur\'s husband Hod will pay you for any firewood obtained by working at the lumber mill (or anywhere else).\r\n\r\nTo Whiterun\r\n\r\nHead out over the bridge out of town and follow the path north to Whiterun. Upon arrival at the main gate, a guard will tell you the city is closed to visitors. Any one of the dialogue options you are presented with will have him let you in the city. Once inside, follow the path up to Dragonsreach and enter. When you approach the Jarl, his housecarl will ask you why you are interrupting the meeting; any dialogue option will gain you an audience. Speak with Jarl Balgruuf to complete the quest and begin the next. The Jarl will reward you with a piece of leveled armor. Whether you receive light or heavy is governed by your aptitude in those skills.',NULL),(9,4,'Bleak Falls Barrow','Meet the Court Wizard\r\n\r\nDuring the final stages of the quest Before the Storm, you will be tasked with a trip from Riverwood to Whiterun to tell Jarl Balgruuf about what happened in Helgen. Make your way to the Dragonsreach palace, where you will be stopped by the housecarl Irileth, who will demand a good reason to interrupt the jarl. You can either tell her about the dragon or report that Riverwood calls for the Jarl\'s aid, both of which will grant you an immediate audience. Deliver the news to Balgruuf, who will order troops to be sent to Riverwood at once and then present you with a reward. He will then remember a job suitable for an adventurer such as yourself and lead you to the court wizard Farengar Secret-Fire, who has been researching dragons. Farengar wants you to fetch the unique Dragonstone from Bleak Falls Barrow, an ancient Nordic tomb near Riverwood. When you question him on what he knows about the quest, he will keep his information sources secret.\r\n\r\nNote: If you already cleared Bleak Falls Barrow and retrieved the Dragonstone during the quest The Golden Claw, then Farengar will prompt you to hand it over immediately and complete the quest. See the notes section for what you may have missed.\r\n\r\nBleak Falls Barrow\r\n\r\nAs the concurrent quest The Golden Claw runs simultaneously with this quest, travel to Riverwood and enter Riverwood Trader. Talk to the proprietor, who will tell you that a precious item was stolen from the main trading room, which will trigger the quest. Locate the ancient barrow and fight the bandits protecting the entrance. Bleak Falls Temple starts with a giant chamber with dead skeevers scattered about and the voices of two bandit inhabitants audible from the back of the room, discussing something of great importance. If you have not yet triggered The Golden Claw, it will begin now, due to the subject of the conversation:\r\n\r\nBandit #1: \"So we\'re just supposed to sit here while Arvel runs off with that golden claw?\"\r\nBandit #2: \"That dark elf wants to go on ahead, let him. Better than us risking our necks.\"\r\nBandit #1: \"What if Arvel doesn\'t come back? I want my share from that claw!\"\r\nBandit #2: \"Just shut it and keep an eye out for trouble.\"',NULL),(10,4,'Dragon Rising','Talk to Jarl Balgruuf\r\n\r\nShortly after you return the Dragonstone to Farengar, a scout will approach to inform him that there has been a sighting of a dragon at the Western Watchtower outside of Whiterun. The scout asks you to meet Jarl Balgruuf in the strategy room. Follow her and Farengar up the stairs beside and behind the Jarl\'s seat. He will tell you to accompany his housecarl, Irileth, as she heads for the western gate. She will recruit several Whiterun Guards along the way.\r\n\r\nMeet Irileth near the Western Watchtower\r\n\r\nFollow Irileth to an area outside the west gate or meet her there. After she delivers a speech to rally her soldiers, follow them west towards the tower.\r\n\r\nYou will gather near the road close to the watchtower to find the watchtower burned and smoking, evidently signs of a recent attack by a dragon. After a short talk, Irileth will give orders to search for survivors. On the north side of the tower, on or around the ramp leading to the interior, you will encounter a single rattled surviving Whiterun Guard, stammering about what he has just been through. Shortly after hearing this, you will hear several warnings that the dragon has returned. Irileth will advise taking cover against the dragon\'s attacks and to \"make every arrow count\".',NULL),(11,4,'The Way of the Voice',NULL,NULL),(12,4,'The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller',NULL,NULL),(13,4,'A Blade in the Dark',NULL,NULL),(14,4,'Diplomatic Immunity',NULL,NULL),(15,4,'A Cornered Rat','',NULL),(16,4,'Alduin\'s Wall',NULL,NULL),(17,4,'The Throat of the World',NULL,NULL),(18,4,'Elder Knowledge',NULL,NULL),(19,4,'Alduin\'s Bane',NULL,NULL),(20,4,'The Fallen',NULL,NULL),(21,4,'The World-Eater\'s Eyrie',NULL,NULL),(22,4,'Sovngarde',NULL,NULL),(23,4,'Dragonslayer',NULL,NULL),(35,7,'A Daedra\'s Best Friend','Man\'s Best Friend\r\n\r\nOnce you reach the required level, a trip to Falkreath will net you an encounter with a guard asking a rather unusual question, namely if you have seen a stray dog running around outside town. Regardless of your answer, he will then point you to local blacksmith Lod who can be found working his smithy during the day. When approached he will only show interest in one specific dog, a \'fine, strong creature that\'s been wandering near town\'. You can either accept his request to chase down the dog or attempt to persuade to pay you part of the gold up-front. He will give you some fresh meat for bait.\r\n\r\nTravel along the road a short distance southwest of town. A dog will approach and enthusiastically address you, saying \"You are exactly what I was looking for\". He will introduce himself as Barbas and will ask for your help. Choose the second option for a bit of background explanation. Barbas will proceed to describe a fallout that he had with his master, and say that he needs someone who can settle the disagreement. Taunting Barbas will make him reveal his master to be Daedric Prince Clavicus Vile; he will proceed to tell you about a cult of worshippers living near Haemar\'s Shame. Barbas will then be on his way towards this cavern, and you will have to follow him on a long journey.\r\n\r\nNote that traveling with Barbas can be avoided by postponing his request during the second set of dialogue responses. This will make Barbas travel to Haemar\'s Shame alone. If you chose that, continue from this section.\r\n\r\nA Long Journey\r\n\r\nHaemar\'s Shame is located a long way from Falkreath, at the foot of the Throat of the World, straight east from the ruined city of Helgen. Following Barbas can be difficult as Barbas tends to get lost on occasion, so keep an eye on the map marker. The first distraction comes when you and Barbas face an unmarked bridge guarded by bandits, just west of Falkreath. Barbas can not be killed by anyone but the player, so just fight the opposition and keep an eye on the dog, who may wander off. Follow Barbas past Pinewatch and up the mountain towards Helgen. The trip goes through the destroyed town, now occupied by bandits, so help Barbas fight them. When all is said and done, Barbas will open the eastern gate himself and continue towards the Throat of the World. When you finally reach Haemar\'s Shame, Barbas will enter right away so follow him inside.\r\n\r\nHaemar\'s Shame\r\n\r\nClavicus Vile obviously suffered the same fate as many other daedric princes, and his shrine is now hidden away in a damp tomb. His worshippers consists of leveled vampires and, even if they all regret their condition, they will protect their shrine with their lives. The first room offers an enemy guarding the wooden structure and a chest. Barbas will have wandered off, so you are on your own. Take the eastern tunnel and beware the spike wall trap ahead. The next chamber contains a campfire and a charred skeever guarded by two vampires. Dispose of them and investigate the wooden structure for an alchemy lab and another chest. Take the only available tunnel to a chamber in two levels, with several enemies to fight. Take a detour to the southern chamber for some loot, and examine the table on your way down for the Destruction skill book Response to Bero\'s Speech, then pick the northern tunnel and exit Haemar\'s Cavern.\r\n\r\nIn the next zone, Haemar\'s Shame, head through the tunnel and kill the residing frostbite spider. An arcane enchanter can be found in the next room, along with soul gem and common books. Head downstream and fight the opposition until you reach the Shrine of Clavicus Vile, guarded by a boss-leveled vampire. Evident by his barking, Barbas will already be there, busy fighting the boss. After the fight, Barbas will sit in front of the statue with nothing to say but the occasional \"Woof\". Head up to the statue, activate it, and ask Clavicus Vile for a request. You will then hear a voice from beyond, saying, \"By all means, let\'s hear it. It\'s the least I could do, since you already helped me grant one final wish for my last worshippers... They were suffering so from vampirism, and begged me for a cure. Then you came and ended their misery! I couldn\'t have planned it better myself. So, what\'s your heart\'s desire? What kind of deal can we strike?\" You can mention Barbas, ask for world peace or invulnerability, but Clavicus is only interested in one thing, the Rueful Axe, an axe powerful enough for Clavicus to have â€˜quite a bit of funâ€™. Clavicus then explains that the axe is located in Rimerock Burrow and will ask you to take his mutt with you. Talking to Barbas will provide a bit of background information on the axe; \"One of Clavicus\'s little jests. A wizard named Sebastian Lort had a daughter who worshipped Hircine. When the daughter became a werewolf it drove Sebastian over the edge. He couldn\'t stand to see his little girl take on such a bestial form. The wizard wished for the ability to end his daughter\'s curse. Clavicus gave him an axe.\"\r\n\r\nRimerock Burrow\r\n\r\nLocated on the hillside in the northernmost corner of the map. Rimerock Burrow can be tricky to find, especially if you approach it from the wrong angle. Take the road leading south from Lost Echo Cave and follow it as it twists and turns. At the crossroads, take the snowy path leading northwest and you will get straight to the entrance.\r\n\r\nInside, you will encounter a hostile flame or frost atronach, presumably created by Sebastian Lort as an extra guardian. Sebastian himself can be found in the next room, equally hostile and will not hesitate to use his conjuration spells. After the battle, claim the Rueful Axe from the table and examine the room for a bit of loot, an alchemy lab and, on Sebastianâ€™s night stand, the Conjuration skill book 2920, Hearth Fire, v9. It is now time to return to Clavicus Vile in Haemar\'s Shame.\r\n\r\nPut him out of our misery!\r\n\r\nBack at Haemar\'s Shame, the map marker will point towards the cavern entrance, which will force you to travel through the entire cave system once again. To circumvent this, head north up the road until the path bends. A pine rests against the mountain wall, so with a bit of climbing, you will be able to reach the back entrance easily. Inside the cavern, Barbas will once again sit in front of his master. When approached, Clavicus Vile has one final prank to play and will give you a choice: you can keep the Rueful Axe if you use it to kill Barbas. The dog will understandably jump up and try to tell you that it is not the only option available. Speak to Barbas and Clavicus Vile for further elaboration and make a decision. Kill Barbas and keep the Rueful Axe, or hand the axe to Clavicus Vile and receive his true daedric artifact, namely the Masque of Clavicus Vile. Note that both items are unique, but only the Masque of Clavicus Vile counts towards the Oblivion Walker achievement, so it is recommended to keep Barbas alive. Regardless of your choice, Barbas and Clavicus Vile will be reunited and you will receive your reward. Finally, return to Lod in Falkreath for a small amount of gold and his gratitude.',NULL),(36,7,'Ill Met By Moonlight','Quick Walkthrough\r\n\r\n1. (Optional) Speak to Mathies, the father of the slain child in Falkreath.\r\n2. Talk to Sinding, who is in a jail cell located in the Falkreath barracks.\r\n3.

Speak with Hircine.\r\n',NULL),(33,6,'Waking Nightmare','Detailed Walkthrough\r\n\r\nRestless Nights\r\n\r\nUpon entering Dawnstar you hear talk of the inhabitants suffering from terrible nightmares and lack of sleep. Even the Jarl himself is having trouble sleeping, and tension is high. Make your way to the Windpeak Inn, where you will find Erandur, a priest of Mara. He warns that the inhabitants of Dawnstar are in terrible danger, as the nightmares are a symptom of having their memories stolen by the Daedric Prince Vaermina. He explains that the nightmares are being caused by an event that happened in Nightcaller Temple, a ruin located on the clifftop overlooking Dawnstar. Erandur will prompt you to follow him to Nightcaller Temple to put an end to the nightmares.\r\n\r\nTemple of Doom\r\n\r\nMake your way with Erandur to the Temple, and speak to him once more outside the door. He will explain why the nightmares are occurring: Many years ago, a group of Orcish Invaders attacked the temple, which had been a shrine to Mara before being overrun with Vaermina\'s priests. To defend themselves, the priests released a gas called \"The Miasma\", which the priests used to elongate their lives. The concentration of Miasma sent both the Orc invaders and the priests into a sleep that lasted for years. After speaking to him, head inside the Temple. If you have a follower, the follower will not enter.\r\n\r\nThere is a working shrine of Mara on the left side wall inside the ruined temple. On the bottom shelf of the podium in the middle of the first room there is a book Lost Legends which activates the quest Forbidden Legend. Two skeevers inhabit the hall near the back, and a lectern on the raised area contains books. A novice level chest is on the right side of the large carving on the back wall. Once the room is cleared, Erandur will unlock the carving with a spell, after which the wall will turn purple and reveal a doorway. Make your way through the opening and follow Erandur to the balcony overlooking the tower\'s inner sanctum.\r\n\r\nThe inner sanctum contains the Skull of Corruption, one of Vaermina\'s artifacts. Erandur explains that the Skull has gained the ability to reach out to people without being wielded, and is stealing memories. The Skull must be destroyed in order for the nightmares to stop. Follow him down the stairs, where you will meet two Orcish Invaders at the bottom. After confronting them, you will find the way ahead blocked by a forcefield. Erandur will say that there may be a way of opening it, but he would have to search for the answer in an alchemy book located in the locked Library upstairs. Luckily, he has a keyâ€”a leftover from when he was himself a Priest of Vaermina. When the Orcs attacked, he had fled, leaving his companions to die, and in his shame over this, he turned to following Mara.\r\n\r\nWords of power\r\n\r\nFollow Erandur back up the stairs and allow him to unlock the door to the library. The inhabitantsâ€”Orcish Invaders and Vaermina Devoteesâ€”will awaken and attack. The Vaermina Devotees fight with lightning as well as conventional weapons, so a Resist Shock potion and other defenses against magic may be useful here. The library is split into two levels. The bookcases on the lower level make it quite a tight squeeze but provide useful cover from incoming spells.\r\n\r\nAfter all the enemies are defeated, Erandur will ask you to help find the book, The Dreamstride. This contains the information needed to breach the inner sanctum. The majority of the books in the library are burnt, but a few remain intact. The Dreamstride is located on the upper level in the south-east corner of the room, on a lectern. Take it back to Erandur, who will decipher the book and state that you must use a potion called \"Vaermina\'s Torpor.\" This allows the taker to use dreams to travel across distances in the real world. As a Priest of Mara, he is unable to use the potion, but says that you will be able to do so. Only the unaffiliated or the followers of Vaermina can use it. To find the potion, go to the laboratory, which adjoins the library.\r\n\r\nMad Alchemist\r\n\r\nFollow Erandur to the laboratory, where you will encounter another Orcish Invader and a Vaermina Devotee. Continue down the corridor, and fight off more Vaermina Devotees and Orcish Invaders. You may find it easier to back through the doorway and tackle the enemies one at a time; Erandur is quite capable of dealing with them. After they are defeated, you can look for the torporâ€”a tall red bottle located on the lower level in a bookcase near the northeast corner of the room. Numerous other alchemical ingredients and potions line the shelves, and on the top level near to where Erandur is waiting, there is a skill book on Alchemy; Mannimarco, King of Worms, on a half-buried bookshelf. Speak to Erandur, and he will command you to drink the potion. It\'s a good idea to save your game here.\r\n\r\nDreamwalker\r\n\r\nUpon taking the potion, you are transported to the inner sanctum in the tower, which you experience in a blurry, psychedelic vision. Two of Vaermina\'s Devotees are talking. Though everything is quite hazy, you can discern from what they are saying that you have traveled back in time to the moment of the Orc invasion of the temple. One of the men addresses you as \"Brother Casimir\", and asks if you are ready to release the Miasma.\r\n\r\nThere is a clattering noise in the background. You cannot access your inventory or map while in the Dreamwalk, nor can you pick up items or fight; you will not get attacked, however. Reply that you are ready, then head down the corridor and into the dining hall. You will see battles and corpses along the way. Make a left into a bedchamber. Head up the stairs and then down the passage on the right. Navigate a winding path onwards until you reach the upper level overlooking the sanctum. Locate a chain with a large ring-shaped pull and activate it. This will release the Miasma. You will then awaken.\r\n\r\nBreaking the Barrier\r\n\r\nWhen your objective updates to \"Disable the Magical Barrier\", take the soul gem from just to the left of the pull chain. The forcefield will deactivate. Talk to Erandur, and he will report that you disappeared and reappeared on the other side of the barrier, and that you can now access the Skull of Corruption. Follow Erandur toward the Skull, taking care of several Orcs and Vaermina Devotees you will encounter along the way. You may confront some challenging battles here. Hanging back behind Erandur and some strategic retreats can be an effective tactic, but you will likely face the powerful battleaxes of some of the Orcs on a few occasions, or the Devotees\'s shock spells, both of which can deal heavy damage. Erandur will pause if he begins to get very far ahead of you.\r\n\r\nAt one point, two Vaermina Devotees, Veren and Thorek (the two devotees conversing at the start of your Dreamwalk), emerge from the Skull\'s shrine and argue with Erandur. Your objective becomes to defeat them as they attack you and Erandur. Defeat them, then Erandur will begin to take down a barrier protecting the Skull. But as he does so, Vaermina will speak to you:\r\n\r\n\"He\'s deceiving you. When the ritual\'s complete, the Skull will be free and then Erandur will turn on you. Quickly! Kill him now. Kill him and claim the Skull for your own! Vaermina commands you!\" \r\n\r\nAt this point, you can kill Erandur and take the skull, or spare him and take him on as a follower. Killing him is not considered a crime.\r\n\r\nIf you ignore the Vaermina\'s command, Erandur will destroy the skull and then offer to travel with you as a follower. If you choose this option, you will be one Daedric Artifact short of the 15 you need for the Oblivion Walker Achievement. Obtaining two Artifacts from one quest will then be required, and the only way you can do that is by obtaining both the Ring of Hircine and the Savior\'s Hide from the Daedric quest Ill Met By Moonlight.\r\n\r\nAfter making your choice, the quest will complete. Whichever option you choose, the nightmares will be lifted from Dawnstar.',NULL),(34,6,'Pieces of the Past','Receiving the Quest\r\n\r\nSometime after you reach level 20, the Courier will deliver to you the Dawnstar Museum Pamphlet, announcing the opening of the museum and noting that admission is free. This activates the miscellaneous quest, \"Visit the museum in Dawnstar\".\r\n\r\nAlternatively, at or above level 20, you may initiate Pieces of the Past by speaking to Silus Vesuius outside his home in Dawnstar.\r\n\r\nVisit the Museum\r\n\r\nSpeak to Silus Vesuius at his house in Dawnstar. He will offer you a tour of the museum, after which he will ask you to retrieve the three pieces of Mehrunes\' Razor. If you accept, he will give you The Keepers of the Razor which contains his \"notes\" about the Razor, including information on the locations of the pieces. The quest will initiate in your journal and the location for each piece will appear on your map.\r\n\r\nIf you return to Silus at the museum in Dawnstar after obtaining each piece, he will reward you with gold and tell you that he needs any remaining parts. However, you may also wait and return all three pieces together.\r\n\r\nRetrieve the Pommel\r\n\r\nThe pommel of Mehrunes\' Razor is at Dead Crone Rock, southwest of Markarth.\r\n\r\nGetting to Dead Crone Rock\r\n\r\nDue to the mountainous terrain, navigating there from Markarth can be frustrating (or adventuresome, depending on your attitude). If the destination is selected as your current objective, the Clairvoyance spell serves as a reliable supplement to your compass.\r\n\r\nExit the city by the eastern gate and proceed eastwards along the road. Passing the first bridge over the river to your right, proceed on the main road and cross the bridge toward Whiterun, as indicated by the signpost. Shortly thereafter, take an easily-seen dirt path to the right. After a short way, where the rocky cliffs on both sides of the path drop back and water can be seen ahead, you will likely encounter randomly-generated enemies. This sometimes involves some kind of group or individual battling another; if so, allowing the fighting to complete can thin out some of your enemies before you are engaged. You may deal with anything from a pack of wolves fighting a stray dog, to a group of bandits, to a spriggan and possibly their usual consorts, to bands of Forsworn Briarhearts attended by mages. If you do not witness a battle, one is likely to have just finished, so after you have dealt with whatever attacks you, you may wish to take a look around the area for corpses to loot.\r\n\r\nAt this point, if you have completed the quest The Taste of Death, the Reachcliff Secret Entrance will be on your left after the bridge.\r\n\r\nContinuing on, you may next encounter an animal or two, such as a bear, which may be dead, hibernating on or near the road, or aggressive. Soon thereafter, you will reach the orc camp Dushnikh Yal where the guard Nagrub will engage you in dialogue if you get close enough, leading to any of a number of outcomes. You may avoid this conversation and discovery of the camp if you wish: Just before reaching the camp, take a sharp right around the stone outcropping (this turn is not always easily seen on approach), and follow the path as it continues in this direction. At the first right turn, an iron ore vein sits directly in front of you. There may be an animal such as a bear present who may or may not see you. The path ahead is sometimes difficult to follow. Wind along it until you reach a bridge crossing a river. You will see part of Hag Rock Redoubt on the far (western) side.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the bridge, there is a choice to make about your route. Whichever you choose, you will need to pass through at least some part of the heavily-guarded exterior zone of Hag Rock Redoubt to reach Dead Crone Rock. Both ways will involve some serious battles, but one will pit you against fewer enemies than the other.\r\n\r\nThe Easy Way Or you can just keep going left and climb the mountain\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hard Way\r\n\r\nTake the left fork in the path just prior to passing under a stone arch. Your goal is to reach the entry door to the interior of Hag Rock Redoubt before encountering any enemies. Follow the path, ascending two small sets of stone steps. Proceed through a stone archway and then straight ahead to the door. Enter and contend with some leveled Forsworn and probably a mage or two. Many of these can be dispatched with sneak/bow attacks, but it may be wise to poison your weapon and prepare for some fairly powerful attacks. Follow your compass to the top of the zone. You will face the heaviest fighting near the exit from at the top of a circular staircase. To minimize the number of strong enemies, stay to the west as much as possible once you emerge from it. When all is clear, skip down to the section below, \"Dead Crone Rock.\"\r\n\r\n[edit] The Harder Way\r\n\r\nThere are two difficult routes through Hag Rock Redoubt. These do not involve travelling through its interior zone. To experience the greatest number of powerful enemies simultaneously, proceed up the left fork of the path as in the preceding paragraph, but go straight past the entry door to the ruin. Soon after you pass the door, a large number of enemies will become alert to your presence (and more will be on the way). These will involve leveled Forsworn, mages, and probably a Frost or Storm Atronach. When this area is clear, find the dome-shaped hut ahead containing an alchemy table. If you are ready for more, you can turn to the east, cross the bridge, and fight your way down a short tower back to the fork in the path from which you began this part of the trip. You can alternatively leave these alone and proceed onward as described in the second paragraph below.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, instead of taking the fork to the left, proceed straight, pass under the stone archway, and enter the short tower after battling its defenders. Once you have entered the structure, climb upwards. After the first flight of stone steps is a flight of wooden steps. It is easy to get stuck if you stray off of the wooden platform at its base. In fact, there are multiple places around the area in which you may become stuck. For this reason, as well as mass of powerful enemies you will confront, you may wish to save frequently. At the top of the tower, cross the bridge to the west. Near its midpoint a large number of enemies will begin to attack you, including leveled Forsworn, mages, and probably a Frost or Storm Atronoch. You will face about the same number of enemies as if you took the route described in the paragraph immediately above, but somewhat more sequentially.\r\n\r\nNext, you will ascend several sets of wide, impressive stairs generally to the west of the small round hut containing an alchemy table. At the base of the second staircase lies a trap activated by a tripwire that will release boulders from an overhead arch. With good luck or exquisite planning, this can be used against yet another set of enemies who await just above. These will comprise a number of powerful attackers simultaneously, including perhaps a Forsworn Briarheart, a mage, and a Troll, each capable of dealing out very powerful attacks.\r\n\r\nDead Crone Rock\r\n\r\nContinue up the stairs to the west until they end; here the path turns you to the left and up one more short stairway to Dead Crone Rock.\r\n\r\nOnce inside, ascend a series of tiers, battling Forsworn and mages along the way. At the top of the second flight of stairs, a metal gate must be unlocked by a lever in another room. To reach the lever, enter the room containing a long banquet table, on which sits an arcane enchanter, and continue past the fire trap. Deactivate this trap by taking the soul gem from which the flames emanate. Enter the short, dark hallway to access a small room containing the lever. A pressure plate activating another fire trap awaits the unwary on the floor of this hall. The Alchemy skill book, A Game at Dinner, sits in front of the lever. The locked wooden door on this level leads to a small external balcony area containing some loot.\r\n\r\nContinue upwards to the pinnacle of the ruin, where Drascua, the ruin\'s Hagraven leader, possesses the pommel. Obtain it, and then find the word wall behind a large altar. A Stone of Barenziah and two soul gems bedeck the altar. A chest near one of its corners contains some valuables.\r\n\r\nRetrieve the Blade Shards\r\n\r\nThe Razor\'s blade shards are held in the basement vault of Cracked Tusk Keep, a fort occupied by Orc bandits.\r\n\r\nGetting to Cracked Tusk Keep\r\n\r\nThe Keep is located west of Falkreath.\r\n\r\nON FOOT FROM THE GUARDIAN STONES: If you have not discovered Falkreath and prefer a trek to a carriage ride there, you can travel on foot or horseback from The Guardian Stones, located southwest of Riverwood. The following guide traces the Clairvoyance Spell pathing, which serves as a reliable guide from the Stones to the Keep.\r\n\r\nTake the road uphill then bear right at the fork you will soon encounter.\r\n\r\nThe section of road running alongside Lake Ilinalta borders several caves and barrows/ruins, setting off a number of encounters with the likes of animals, particularly Wolves; monsters, particularly Frostbite Spiders; groups of leveled bandits, likely including bandits who may cast shock spells; hostile Orcs; and Vampires who are often present on or close to the road, searching for fresh blood from their lair in the nearby North Shriekwind Bastion ruin. If trouble does not find you in this area, you won\'t need to look far to find some. If you shoot first and ask questions later, however, you may find yourself having committed the crime of murder, as non-hostile characters may also be encountered here. One spot in which you are likely to encounter someone or something is just past the large boulder positioned on the right side of the road where it departs from the lakeside. There is an iron ore vein here: Westwards from the boulder extends a patch of rocks sited between the road and the river in an essentially rectangular formation. The vein lies at the northwest corner of this.\r\n\r\nContinue west, then take a left turn onto another road. This has no signpost and can be overlooked if you\'re not watching for it.\r\n\r\nFollow this road as it winds to the bottom of a hill. Just after it reaches the bottom and levels out, take a smaller path to the right. This is intermittently paved with flagstones and will soon point you directly at the Keep.\r\n\r\nCracked Tusk Keep\r\n\r\nThe Keep\'s exterior is relatively-lightly guarded by orcs and bandits, typically of the Bandit Archer class, who tend to attack with bows from a distance and melee weapons up-close. They are better-trained in one-handed weapons and so can be more dangerous when wielding them. They are non-magical.\r\n\r\nA surgical sniping approach may be accomplished by sneaking around a wide arc to the right of the fort and climbing the mountain from the other side. You should have any follower wait before you find a way to climb up. It may require luck, patience and persistence to find a way up and over that lands you in a position from which you can see and kill one or more guards below. If you can do so, and then sneak into the interior through one of several vulnerabilities in the perimeter, it is possible to eliminate all of the guards without any of them even seeing you. The access point of choice is probably a deteriorated breach in the wall located on the north wall near the northeast corner. Climbing up here will allow you to reach an elevated wooden platform from which you can sometimes see and kill remaining guards. (Another breech near this corner but on the east side allows you to access a partially-buried chest, but presents a more difficult if not impossible route inside.)\r\n\r\nThere are three entrances into the keep\'s first interior zone. If you take the front door, you will be immediately attacked by two enemies of the same type as the guards. Incapacitate them and proceed up the stairs and through the door, where the bandit chief, Ghunzul wields more advanced melee weaponry, and wears stronger heavy armor as well as the key to the vault. There is a second vault key on the chest next to his bed.\r\n\r\nA second entrance is a hatch on the roof of the circular structure at the southeast corner of the exterior which will drop you directly into Ghunzul\'s quarters. To find it, take the stairs to the right just after entering the exterior gate to the fort. Work your way around the walls and elevated platforms of the perimeter counter-clockwise until you reach it. This will require a tricky jump at one point which can land you in an area where you may become stuck.\r\n\r\nIf you obtain the key, proceed two levels down to enter Cracked Tusk Vaults.\r\n\r\nThe third entrance is a locked door to the right of the main entrance and down some steps. This opens directly into the unguarded room which accesses the vault zone. If you have sufficient lockpicking capabilities, it can allow you to access the vault and the quest item without encountering any enemies in the interior.\r\n\r\nThere is a sliding panel on the wall to the right of the cage barring access to Cracked Tusk Vaults. It can be opened with the key or by picking a difficult lock.\r\n\r\nOpen the next door. Two barred rooms on either side of the hallway, each containing significant loot, are unlocked by small buttons on the wall to the right of each. The room to the left contains Rislav The Righteous, a light armor skill book.\r\n\r\nActivating the levers to the left and right of the final barrier will open the way to the blade shards. Three tripwires on the floor between you and the shards activate dart traps; these may be jumped over. Removing the blade shards from their pedestal will also activate a dart trap. Placing something, like the nearby bucket, onto the pedestal will deactivate the trap--if you can get something to remain on the surface of the pedestal. However, you may also turn to the left as you face the pedestal, and take an alternative route back through the room. Other options include simply taking some damage from the traps or using the Become Ethereal shout to protect yourself on the way back out.\r\n\r\nRetrieve the Hilt\r\n\r\nTo get the hilt, speak to Jorgen in the town of Morthal. He will initially claim not to have it, and when he admits that he does, he will refuse to give it to you. To gain access to it, you may use one of the speech challenges: threaten, persuade, or bribe. If successful, he will give you the key to his house west of the mill and another to the chest within it containing the hilt. You can also just take the hilt from the chest without speaking to Jorgen by picking the locks or pickpocketing the key(s) from Jorgen.',NULL);
